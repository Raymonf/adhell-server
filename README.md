# adhell-server

Does magic. Read the code to figure out how to set it up. The code is bad. I did this in 30 minutes because lazy.

`AdhellDaemon` is the C# part - it rebuilds the APK (after changing the package name) as necessary. You need apktool and a decompiled version of Adhell.

`adhell-web` is the Laravel part.
